		<p>Who doesn't love Cards Against Humanity? We'll tell you who... the Introverts! <br>

		<br>

		<p>We just want to unite with other <span id="horrible">HORRIBLE</span> people but separately, in the safety of our own homes. Now we can, with Cards Against Singularity!</p>

	<h3 class="rules">How To Play</h3>

	<br>

	<ol>
		<li>Sign in via Facebook</li>

		<br>

		<li>Pick your Poison: Player or Czar.</li>

		<br>

		<li>As Player, you will view question cards and submit your best answer card from your hand... just waiting to be judged by others. No pressure though.</li>

		<br>

		<li>As Czar, you will view a collection of question/answer card pairs submitted by your fellow introverts and judge their humor. Funny? That player gets an awesome point. Not funny? Shoot them down and hope they cry</li>
