	<p><span>Q:</span> Who doesn't love EVERYTHING about Cards Against Humanity?<br>

	<br>

	<span>A:</span> The Introverts! <br>

	<p>We just want to unite with other <span>HORRIBLE</span> people but Separately, in our own homes. Now we can, with Cards Against Singularity! We all love Cards Against Humanity but we don’t always love people.<br>

	<br>


 Cards Against Singularity looks to fix that by allowing online play via FaceBook Login.	<br>

 	<br>


Playing Cards Against Singularity on your mobile phone will allow you to quickly scroll through a combiniation of Question and Answer Cards and vote on what you think is the Best answer, allowing the player who submitted the answer card to rack up points.	<br>

	<br>

Because its a web app its cross platform so you can play with iOS and android. Still have a flip phone? Well, if it can get online you can play Cards Against Singularity. The best part of all, when you’re done, clean up is as easy as turning your phone off. 	<br>
