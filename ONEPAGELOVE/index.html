				<h2>What is CARDISTRY?</h2>

  <p class="intro">Cardistry is the non-magical manipulation of playing cards with intent to display creativity, performance art, and skill...<br>

<br>

	We all love card games but we don’t always have a deck with us. Cardistry looks to fix that by turning your tablet into a game board and your smart phones into your playing hand. 
	By using a tablet as a game board, we preserve the social aspect of playing a game of cards. In a game of cards against humanity, for example, the dealer will see the other players chosen cards face down and shuffled. The dealer then flips the cards over and taps the screen to choose the winner, the black card will then slide to the position of the winning player.<br>

<br>

	With your playing hand in your smartphone, you won’t need to remember if drew after your last turn. Also, since you’re using your phone as your hand, people will be looking at their phones as a way to be involved instead of as an escape.<br>

<br>

	Because its a web app its cross platform so you can play with iOS, android, laptop, desktop… if it can get online you can play with Cardistry. The best part of all, when you’re done, clean up is as easy as turning your phone off.<br>

<br>

	This application is made with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Angular, AngularFire, FireBase and a JSON file of about 3000 cards I found.

 	<h2>How do you Play?</h2>

	<blockquote>

	<p>To start the game, each player draws ten white "answer" cards. <br>

		<br>

		One randomly chosen player begins as the Card Czar, and plays a black "question" card. The Card Czar reads the question out to the group. <br>

		<br>

		Each player answers the question by passing one white "answer" card, face down, to the Card Czar. The Card Czar shuffles all of the answers, reads them out loud in a humorous fashion, and picks their favorite. <br>

		<br>

		Whoever played that answer gets to keep the Black Card as one Awesome Point. After each round, a new player becomes the Card Czar, and every player draws back up to ten cards.</p>
